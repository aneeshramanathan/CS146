We first check if the root is null and if the root is null we can return that is true. We set the value of a left max and a right max because every time we have to compare that value with the ancestor to make sure that it is fully a binary search tree. We created two helper methods to do that and they iterate until the max value is found. After that I use a if statement to check if the binary tree makes sense. If it doesn't then we can see that it won't be a bst so we return false automatically. Then we iterate through the tree recursively first down the left side then the right side. At the end of the code we want to check if all nodes are in the correct position and depending on that the code will return true or false if both the left and the right side are bsts.
