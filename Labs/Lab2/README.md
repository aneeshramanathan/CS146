Since we had to check if the 2 words that we put as parameters for the method are anagrams of each other I first decided to check if they are the same length because if they aren't the same length then the function should return the boolean value as false. I then deicded to make the two strings into 2 seperate arrays holding each character as each value. I then decided to sort the two character arrays that I created for each string. After I sorted both arrays I used a for loop with an if statement inside the for loop to check each value in each array to make sure that they are equal to each other at the same index.
