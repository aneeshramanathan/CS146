In order to do a topological sort we have to use a list and a priority queue as talked about in class. We first start off creating an adjacency list which will store the items in the graph. We will also create a array with the indegrees. We iterate through the array and update the list and array with the values corresponding to it. Then we have to perform the topological sort. We use a priority queue for the sort. We add all the values with 0 indegree to the queue and use a counter variable to keep track of the number of courses that have been processed. For each neighbor we have to increase the indegree by 1 and then we enqueue the neighbor since all the pre-reqs have been satisfied. At the end we have to return the value of whether the count and the numberOfCourses is the same and if they are it will return true if not then it will return false.
