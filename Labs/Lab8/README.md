I decided to use a dynammic programming approach to this problem where I started off creating an array called dp with the size amount+1. We know that the base case is 0 so we set the first value of the array to 0. We iterate through the coin array and in the nested for loops we have to update the minimum coins. We update dp[j] to the minimum of the current value and then we calculate the value after we subtract the coin value we just chose. At the end we check if the dp[amount] is not equal to the max value and if that is true we return dp[amount] otherwise we return -1 as stated in the question.
