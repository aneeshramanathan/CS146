I first started off by removing all the non alphanumeric characters by using a for loop to go through each character and checking if they are a number or a alphabet using an if statement. After I removed all the alphanumeric characters I converted the new string that I created to all lower case. I created 2 varaibles one for the beginning index and one for the end index. Then I used a while loop to check the characters at the beginning of the new string and the end of the new string. If it was equal then the code will go to the next character from the beginning and second character from the end. If two characters did not match the code returned the boolean value false and the code will not continue after that. If everything worked and the while loop finished then the code will return the value true.
