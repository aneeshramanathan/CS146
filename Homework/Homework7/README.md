We first start off by sorting the 2d array intervals by the start times. This way we have the server times in the correct order. Then we decided to use the priority queue to store the server times end that are currently happening. After that we use a for loop so that we can iterate through each interval and inside the for loop we set the start time to the first array inside the interval and the end time to the second value inside the first array in intervals. I then decided to use a while loop so that it goes until the current server is ended and once that server is ended we remove that server from the priority queue. This ends the while loop and now we are in the for loop where we add the end time of the server that just happened. Then the for loop also exits and the for loop goes for the whole array intervals. At the end of the method, we return the size of the priority queue which represents the number of servers that are required.
