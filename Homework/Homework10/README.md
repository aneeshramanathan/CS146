We first started off by initializing an empty list which would hold the solution values. In this case I wanted to use breadth first search so I decided to use the queue data structure. We started off by checking the root node and putting that into the queue. We use a while loop which goes until the queue is empty. Since we are doing this by levels we want to keep track of the levels that we are going through so we create an integer that holds the size of the queue which represents which level we are at. Then since we have to return a list inside a list we use another list to store the values of each level and then put each level into the big list. We iterate through the current level. Everytime we do that we will dequeue a node, add that value to the currentLevel list and then enqueue the right and left children if they exist. At the end of the program we return the final list that has multiple lists from each level inside of the big outer list.
