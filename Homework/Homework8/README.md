In this problem I decided to use a hashmap as we just learned it in class and I wanted to get more practice with it. I first initialized a hashmap then I iterated through the string and checked which letter is already in the hashmap. I added each letter to the hashmap with a default value of 0 occurences and then if that character showed up again then I increased the counter of the integer value in the hashmap. I wanted to count the number of odd values that I found and then I would return the value of the total string minus the odd values. I created a variable that would count odds. I then created another for loop that would iterate through the hashmap and see if the integer value was divisible by 2. If it was not divisible by 2 then I increase the oddCount variable. At the end of the program I checked to see if oddCount was equal to 0 and if it was then we would return the whole palindrome otherwise we would return the number of letters minus the oddcount which would give the values that were even.
