In this problem I decided to use a hashmap as we just learned it in class and I wanted to get more practice with it. I first initialized a hashmap then I iterated through the string and checked which letter is already in the hashmap. If the character is already in the hashmap I increased the occurence count by 1 and if it was not in the hashmap I added that character to the hashmap and set the integer value to 1. After that for loop I created another for loop that went through each value in the hashmap and if the character's integer pair was odd then I would increase a counter varaible. I used the odd values so that I can just subtract that from the total amount of letters. At the end of the code I returned the the length of the string subtracted by the counter variable and then you add a 1 to account for the extra value that was missed.
