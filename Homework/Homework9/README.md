I used a recursive approach to this problem as it is easier to parse through the tree using a recursive approach. We first traverse through the left side and then we traverse through the right side. We do this because we can assume that if one is on the right and one is on the left then the parent has to be between them. If both the nodes aren't on the right side or on the left side then we just return the parent because that is the lowest common ancestor. If that is the case the first two if statements don't run because both the values are on the same side. The first two if statements parse through the tree until both are on the same side and if they are on the same side it returns the node that is the lowest common ancestor.
