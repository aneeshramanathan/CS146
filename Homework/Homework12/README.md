First there is a well with the number 0 and then we have to take the connectivity between the house and well with 0 as an edge. The connectiviy between two houses is also considered an edge for us. We basically use Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree. We create a list where we add the edge that connects the well with 0 and the house. After we add all the arrays we have to sort the array in ascending order so that we can traverse each edge easily. If the edge connects components that are already connected then we merge these two wells and create an edge. If the connection comes out to be 1 then we have found a MST. At the end we return the current weight of all the edges.
