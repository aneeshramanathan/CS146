I decided to use a binary search in order to find the first value that is bad. I created two varaibles one for the lowest and one for the highest. I set the lowest to the number 1 and the highest to the value of n. Because we want the first bad version before n then we choose n as the highest value. I used a while loop so that it goes until the value is found and then inside the while loop I created a mid varaible which holds the middle of the list. Using the middle I check the first half of the list and then the second half of the list. I check the bad version at the middle and depending I will change the value of greatest and least. Greatest changes if isBadVersion(mid) returns true and greatest changes to mid and if that is false least will change to mid + 1. At the end of the code I returned the varaible least which will give the first badversion. The while loop will stop once least and greatest are equal to each other then it will return least.
