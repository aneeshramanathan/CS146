1. Calculate the in degree for each vertex in the graph then we initialize a queue with vertices having an in degree of 0 and start the BFS. In the BFS we keep track of the in degree of neighboring vertices and add them to a queue if their in degree becomes 0. Once the BFS is done we check if the resulting list matches the number of vertices and we add them to the queue if the in degree becomes 0.
2. We first create the adjacency list then we build the graph using the vertices. We create a seperate DFS function which starts from a given node and then it marks each as visited as it explores the neighbors. After DFS traversal, the vertices are stored in a stack. We pop elements from the stack to retrieve the topological ordering, as the finishing time of vertices will be in reverse topological order.
