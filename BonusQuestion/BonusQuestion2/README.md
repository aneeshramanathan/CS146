We first created a tree node class where it contains the left and right values of the node and then also the data value that is associated with the node. Then I have the redblack tree class which contains the methods that are needed for the red black tree. I have added the delete, insert and search method which use recursion to parse through the tree. The search method takes a key as a parameter and will return a boolean value if that value is in the tree or not. We use a helper method for the search. In the search method we have a base case which checks if the node is null or we found the node. Then we iterate through the left side of the tree and the right side of the tree using recursion. The insert method uses the search algorithm and at the end we have to make sure that the tree is blanced so we have to use the helper methods isRed. At the end you return the node after it is places in the tree. The delete method is very similar to the insert method but instead of adding a value you want to delete that value. At the end of the class there are a few methods like rotateRight, rotateLeft, flipColors, and isRed. All of these methods are used to help balance the tree after the insert and delete methods are performed.
